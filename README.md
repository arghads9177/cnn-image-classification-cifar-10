# **Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset**

## Project Overview  
This project involves building a robust image classification model using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, a widely-used benchmark dataset for image recognition tasks. The dataset consists of small 32x32 color images belonging to 10 distinct classes. The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying images into these categories.

## About the Dataset  

### Dataset Description  
The **CIFAR-10 dataset** consists of:  
- **60,000 images** in total.  
- Each image is **32x32 pixels** and colored (RGB).  
- **10 classes**, with **6,000 images per class**.  

### Dataset Splits  
- **Training Set:** 50,000 images.  
- **Test Set:** 10,000 images.  

### Data Organization  
- The training set is divided into **five batches**, each containing 10,000 images.  
- The test set contains **1,000 images per class**, selected randomly.  
- Training batches may have slight imbalances, but the dataset ensures exactly **5,000 images per class** in total.  

### Class Labels  
The 10 mutually exclusive classes in the dataset are:  
- **airplane**
- **automobile**
- **bird**
- **cat**
- **deer**
- **dog**
- **frog**
- **horse**
- **ship**
- **truck**  

#### Notes:  
- Classes are **mutually exclusive**, with no overlap between categories.  
- "Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, etc., while "Truck" refers to large trucks (excluding pickup trucks).
